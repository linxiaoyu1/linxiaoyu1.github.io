Hi! Welcome to my webpage. My name is Xiaoyu Lin, and it writes 林小钰 in Chinese. 

<!-- 2024.03 -->
<!-- I am currently a final-year PhD student at the [RobotLearn Team](https://team.inria.fr/robotlearn/) at [Inria Grenoble-Rhône-Alpes](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-university-grenoble-alpes) in France. My current research direction generally involves applying deep probabilistic generative models for solving intricate scientific and engineering problems under un/semi-/weakly supervised configurations. Particularly, I apply a specific type of deep latent variable model designed for sequential data, referred to as [dynamical variational auto-encoders (DVAEs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12595), to tackle various audio and visual tasks, including multi-object tracking, single-channel audio source separation, and speech enhancement.

My research interests span a broad spectrum of both theoretical and application-oriented machine learning problems. With a focus on advancing both the fundamental understanding and practical applications of machine learning, my long-term research goal is to develop robust and reliable AI systems that not only excel in performance, but also bring positive impact on societal progress and the well-being of individuals. Currently, my research interests primarily focus on the developement of deep probabilistic generative models, un/semi-/weakly supervised representation learning, sequential data modeling and the applications of machine learning algorithm to solve various practical problems.

**Short biography**: Previous to my PhD study at Grenoble, I obtained the Master's degree from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/) in 2020, followed by an Engineer's degree from [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en) in the same year. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree, also from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/), which I completed in 2017. If you want to know more about me, please refer to [this page]({{ '/biography/' | relative_url }}) for a detailed biography of myself. -->

<!-- And I will be joining [Prof. Peng Cui](https://pengcui.thumedialab.com/)’s team in the [Department of Computer Science & Technology at Tsinghua University](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/) as a postdoc researcher at the beginning of 2025. -->

Currently, my research interests primarily focus on understanding the out-of-distribution generalization problem of machine learning models and enhancing the robustness of AI systems in varying environments. One promising research direction that particularly interests me is the integration of causality into current machine learning frameworks.

**Short biography**: I received my PhD from University Grenoble Alpes in 2024, under the supervision of [Dr. Xavier Alameda-Pineda](https://xavirema.eu) and [Professor Laurent Girin](https://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/user/laurent.girin).
