Hi! Welcome to my webpage. My name is Xiaoyu Lin, and it writes 林小钰 in Chinese. 

I am currently a final year PhD student at the [RobotLearn Team](https://team.inria.fr/robotlearn/) at [Inria Grenoble-Rhône-Alpes](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-university-grenoble-alpes) in France. My current research direction generally involves applying deep probabilistic generative models for solving intricate scientific and engineering problems under un/semi-/weakly supervised configurations. Particularly , I apply a specific type of deep latent variable model designed for sequential data, reffered to as [dynamical variational auto-encoders (DVAEs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12595), to tackle various audio and visual tasks, including multi-object tracking, single-channel audio source separation, and speech enhancement.

My research interests span a broad spectrum of theoretical and application machine learning problems. With a focus on advancing both the foundamental understanding and practical applications of machine learning, my long-term research goal is to develop robust and reliable AI systems that not only exel in performance, but also bring positive impact on societal progress and the well-being of individuals. Currently, my research interests primarily focus on the developpement of deep probabilistic generative models, un/semi-/weakly supervised representation learning, sequential data modeling and the applications of machine learning algorithm to solve various scientific and engieering problems.

**Short biography**: Previous to my PhD study at Grenoble, I obtained the Master's degree from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/) in 2020, followed by an Engineer's degree from [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en) in the same year. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree, also from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/), which I completed in 2017.
