I was born in [Xinxiang, Henan](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Xian+de+Xinxiang,+Henan,+Chine/@35.2915556,113.2614657,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x35d99117287bcd45:0xfb38df2ad86c52a3!8m2!3d35.3032299!4d113.92675!16zL20vMDMybjFm?entry=ttu), a picturesque city nestled in the heart of China's east-middle region, alongside the majestic [Yellow River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_River), the second-longest river in the country. With a history dating back thousands of years, Xinxiang is a city that embodies the rich cultural heritage and vibrant spirit of China. Across the ages, its strategic location at the crossroads of major transportation routes has made it a vital center for trade and commerce. This vibrant convergence has cultivated Xinxiang into a melting pot of cultures, where a diverse population of people from various ethnicities and backgrounds contributes to enrich the city's traditions, cuisines, and customs. I grew up and spent the first 18 years of my life there.

After successfully completing the extremly competitive national higher education entrance examination (Gaokao), I started the studies at [École Centrale de Pékin, Beihang University](https://ecpknen.buaa.edu.cn/), in 2013. According to my understandings, this institution represents an experimental Sino-French higher education cooperation project, seeking to integrate the Chinese university educational system with the French [grande école](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_%C3%A9cole) educational system. It is a seven-year program that involves Bachelor's, Master's and French engineering education. The courses during the first three years inlude intensive French language acquisition as well as rigorous instruction in foundational mathematics, physics, and engineering. The majority of scientific courses are conducted in French. This period is similar to the ["classe préparatoire"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles) in France. 

Following three years of Bachelor's studies, in 2016, I was fortunate enough (maybe also due to my diligent work) to obtain the opportunity for a two-year exchange to [École Centrale Paris (now CentraleSupélec)](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en). The first year of studies at Centrale is dedicated to advanced mathematical and physical knowledge, covering a broad spectrum of topics such as probabilities, statistics, quantum and statistical physics, thermal transfer, and more. In the subsequent year, students have the freedom to select courses according to their interests. I consider myself very fortunate to have chosen the Advanced Statistics course taught by Professor [Christine Keribin](https://wp.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/christine-keribin/) and the [Machine Learning](https://cazencott.info/index.php/pages/MA-2823-Foundations-of-Machine-Learning-%28Fall-2017%29) course instructed by Professor [Chloé-Agathe Azencott](https://cazencott.info/index.php). These two courses have sparked my initial interests towards the domain of statistical machine learning. Besides the academic aspects, the initial experience of living in France is also memorable, despite all the challenges of cultural integration at the beginning. The exchange at Centrale concluded in 2018, afer which I returned to China to complete my Master's education. This involved undertaking general courses, conducting a master research thesis and a completing mandatory six-month internship. I completed my Master's degree in June 2020 and commenced my PhD studies in Grenoble in November 2020.

Throughout my academic eductation journey, I have also made several tentative efforts to discover the industrial world. During the summer of 2017, I conducted a two-month internship at [Schlumberger](https://www.slb.com/) in Beijing. This internship involved applying fluid mechanics knowledge, specifically the  Bernoulli Equation, to analyze the velocity of oil flow within pipes. It was my first experience of applying theoretical knowledge from coursework to solve real-world problem. In the summer of 2018, I returned to Schlumberger for a three-month internship. This time, my focus shifted to a data-driven project aimed at predicting the speed of drill bit using historical data. During this project, I have learned a lot about time-series clustering and time-series prediction. Besides, I came to recognize that real-world scenarios encompass far more complicated factors that can be addressed by simply applying theoretical models with ideal assumptions. Furthermore, this project held notable significance for me personally, as it represented my first formal research endeavor. It afforded me the opportunity to navigate the entire research process, from formulating the problem and crafting hypotheses, to exploring potential solutions and evaluating performance metrics. From May 2019 to November 2019, I completed the six-month mandatory internship at a Hedge Funds start-up company in Paris. The internship project centered on applying statistical learning methods to analyze historical trading data and develop new trading strategies. In the summer of 2020, I conducted a 3-month internship at a Chinese AI company dedicated to developing AI solutions for industrial applications. My internship projects focused on applying generative models to predict sequences of precipitation nowcasting radar maps. 

Throughout all my industrial experiences, I have extract several notes from my observations and I conclude them as follows. First, industrial companies has strong requirements for data analysis to improve their production efficiency. Second, the application of machine learning approaches into industrial problems necessites strong domain knowledge. The cooporation between domain experts and data scientists is crutial.
